# Resilience Patterns for Distributed systems

## Overview

This repository is a compilation of working code scripts that complete the [O'Reilly session on Patterns for Distributed Systems](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/design-patterns-for-distributed-systems/0636920061982/0636920061981/) The code here will be used during the session to reason and discuss various patterns and their benefits and applications. 

The code here can remain an independent and open means of learning about the patterns. This guide outlines how different scenarios be executed and impact of pattern is visualized. The guide covers 5 specific patterns and their execution in the repository. 

## Tools / Frameworks used

* Java 11
* Maven
* Springboot 
* JMeter as load generation tool
* Influx db as timeseries store for load metrics
* Grafana as a visualization tool
* RabbitMQ as the distributed message queue
* Docker

Only basic Java knowledge is required to execute the patterns. All other components can be treated as a blackbox.
